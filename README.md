# Parallel-BFS-with-Push-Pull-operation-using-queue-bitmap-using-OpenMP
•	Developed an algorithm for parallelizing BFS with Push/Pull operations using array-queue and bitmap and the race conditions are solved.
•	Implemented various approaches for solving race conditions and the performance for each approach is measured and compared for best approach.
